# Introduction to Version Control

Git is powerful and complicated. We could spend a whole day here, but it is also quite possible to harness it's powers using just three commands: `add`, `commit`, `push`. The goal of this document is not to explain deeply how git works, but to highlight how to get started using git for your projects.

This document is inspired by materials from the [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/index.html) foundation and Rochelle Terman's [Introduction to Computational Tools & Techniques for Social Research](https://github.com/rochelleterman/PS239T). If you are hoping to learn more, these are great places to start.

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Configure git for the first time it is used on your computer.
2. Create a git repository.
3. Go through the modify-add-commit cycle for one or more files.
4. Explain how to collaborate with others using git.
